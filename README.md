I install Ubuntu many times for testing on virtual machines, dockers and occasionally on my machine. Every time, I have to deal with the same stuff of removing unnecessary files, installing the basic tools and making the system ready to use.
So, it made perfect sense to put all that work in a single file and use it every time I install Ubuntu.
Then, I figured it could probably be helpful to other developers in the same space, so here it is!
